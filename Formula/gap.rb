    #   the compiled "bundle" is intended to be used "as is," and there is
    #   no instructions for how to remove the source and other unnecessary
    #   files after compilation.  Moreover, the content of the
    #   subdirectories with special names, such as `bin` and `lib`, is not
    #   suitable for merging with the content of the corresponding
    #   subdirectories of `/usr/local`.  The easiest temporary solution seems
    #   to be to drop the compiled bundle into `<prefix>/libexec` and to
    #   create a symlink `<prefix>/bin/gap` to the startup script.
    #   This use of `libexec` seems to contradict Linux Filesystem Hierarchy
    #   Standard, but is recommended in Homebrew's "Formula Cookbook."
